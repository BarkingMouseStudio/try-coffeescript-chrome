"Try CoffeeScript" for Chrome
===========================

This is a simple utility that performs the same functionality of the "Try CoffeeScript" link in the documentation. Sometimes I use the feature to try out what certain coffee-script would look like in javascript and thought a Chrome extension would be perfect for that.

This is an unofficial extension.
