"Try CoffeeScript" for Chrome
===========================

A simple utility that performs the same functionality of the "Try CoffeeScript" link in the documentation.

This is an unofficial extension.

History:
--------

  * added real-time syntax highlighting (thanks StuPig!)
  * added <tab> indent to the editor (thanks StuPig!)
  * added js2coffee support (thanks JamesKyburz!)
  * added code persistence across sessions (using localStorage)
  * added "Try CoffeeScript" button to run the compiled script
  * removed "disabled" attribute from javascript output (preventing copy+paste...)
