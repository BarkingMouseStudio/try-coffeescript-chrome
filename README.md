"Try CoffeeScript" for Chrome
===========================

This is a simple utility that performs the same functionality of the "Try CoffeeScript" link in the documentation. Sometimes I use the feature to try out what certain coffee-script would look like in javascript and thought a Chrome extension would be perfect for that.

This is an unofficial extension.

History:
* added js2coffee support (thanks JamesKyburz!)
* added code persistence across sessions (using localStorage)
* added "Try CoffeeScript" button to run the compiled script
* removed "disabled" attribute from javascript output (it was preventing copy+paste...)
